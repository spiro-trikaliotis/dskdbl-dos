# dskdbl-dos
A small utility for reading and writing floppy disks on MS-DOS 3.3 and up

This is a small utility I wrote in 1996 or so for reading and writing disk
images with a PC, in order to preserve them.

It was written in C++ with Borland C++ 3.1 (BC++). It should run on any MS-DOS
PC from MS-DOS 3.3 (for support of 3,5" HD) up to MS-DOS 6.22.

This source are provided mostly for nostalgic reasons. If you want to preserve
images on your own, in almost all cases, you are much better served with dd on
Linux or a BSD variant.
